# Bucket-List

New implementations (See ReSwift branch).

This is an application I built to keep in mind the experiences I would like to have, a bucket list. While it is still a work in progress, and there is a lot more that I hope to do with it (i.e. build a cooler UI!), I leveraged a few libraries and frameworks that I feel are crucial to iOS development - Core Data, MapKit, Core Location, GCD.
